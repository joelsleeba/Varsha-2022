# Lecture Notes in Mathematics

I intend to post my notes that I take in class after $\LaTeX$ them. I feel that it will give me very good excuse to review my notes and rephrase it in own words later in the evening after I get back from class. This [answer on Quora](https://qr.ae/pvMgZv) gives a strong argument why it is beneficial.

Here's a quote that I like and wish to implement in my own Mathematical journey:

> "Don't just read it; fight it! Ask your own question, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true?... Where does the proof use the hypothesis?"
