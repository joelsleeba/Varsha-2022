\subsection{Proof of Prime Avoidance Lemma started\dots}
\begin{proof}[Proof of \ref{lemma:prime-avoidance}]
    We prove that the following equivalent statement that:
    
    If for all $j$, $I\not\subset P_j$ for all $j$, there is some element $x\in I$ such that $x\not\in P_j$ for all $j$. $(\star)$


    We prove this theorem by assuming that all but $2$ of the $P_i$ are prime ideals. (Note : this is a slightly weaker assumption!)
    
     We now start the proof using induction.
    
    We first consider the case when $n=2$. Let $I$ be an ideal and $P_1$ and $P_2$ be prime ideals of $A$ such that $I \not \subset P_1$ and $I \not \subset P_2$. So, there are some element $x\in I \setminus P_1$ and $y\in I \setminus P_2$.

    If $x\not \in P_2$ then we are done. Likewise if $y\not \in P_1$ then we are again done. So, we may assume that $x\in P_2$ and $y\in P_1$.

    Now consider $x+y$. Undoubtedly, $x+y \in I$. If it were the case that $x+y \in P_1$ then $x\in P_1$ which is not possible by choice of $x$. Likewise if it were the case that $x+y \in P_2$ then $y \in P_2$ as $x\in P_2$ which again is not possible by choice of $y$. Therefore, we have that $x+y \in I$, $x+y \not \in P_1$ and $x+y \not \in P_2$ and this ends our verification of the base case.

    Now, suppose that the $(\star)$ is true when the number of prime ideals is equal to $n-1$ where $n\ge 3$. 

    Let $I$ be an ideal and $P_1 , P_2 , \ldots , P_n$ be prime ideals such that $I \not \subset P_j$ for $1\le j \le n$. 

    By using the induction hypothesis, there is an element $x\in I$ such that $x \not \in P_j$ for $1 \le j \le n-1$.


    If $x\not\in P_n$ then our proof is complete! So, we assume that $x\in P_n$.
    
    Furthermore, we may assume that for $i\ne j$, it is not the case that $P_i \subset P_j$ or $P_j \subset P_i$, that is, there are no inclusions among the prime ideals. Since $n\ge 3$ and all but $2$ of the $P_j$ are prime ideals, we may assume that $P_n$ is a prime ideal.
    
    We claim that $IP_1 P_2 \ldots P_{n-1} \not\subset P_n$. Suppose not then $I P_1 P_2 \ldots P_{n-1} \subset P_n$. It follows by induction and Lemma \ref{lemma:equiv-prime} that $I \subset P_n$ or $P_i \subset P_n$ for some $1\le j \le n-1$. Note that the latter part of the 'or' cannot hold by our assumption in the previous paragraph. Thus $I \subset P_n$. But then again this is a contradiction! So, we have that $IP_1 P_2 \ldots P_{n-1} \not\subset P_n$.

    Now select a $y\in IP_1 \ldots P_{n-1}$ but $y\not \in P_n$.

    Now, we finish the proof by showing that $x+y \in I$ but $x+y \not \in P_i$ for all $1\le i \le n$. It is evident that $x+y \in I$. If $x+y\in P_n$ then $y\in P_n$ which is not possible by choice of $y$. Note that $y\in IP_1\ldots P_{n-1}$ implies $y\in P_i$ for all $1\le i\le n-1$. Now if $x+y \in P_i$ for some $1\le i \le n-1$ then $x \in P_i$. But that cannot happen by choice of $x$. Thus we have found an element which is in $I$ but not in any of $P_i$ and this completes the proof!

\end{proof}

\begin{notation}
    Let $A$ be a ring. We will use $\text{max-spec} (A)$ to denote the set of all maximal ideals of $A$.
\end{notation}


\begin{definition}[Jacobson Radical]
    Let $A$ be a ring. The Jacobson radical $\calJ (A)$ is defined to by the intersection of all maximal ideals of $A$. In other words,
    \begin{equation*}
	\calJ (A) := \bigcap \left\{ m : m \in \text{max-spec} (A) \right\}
    \end{equation*}
    \label{def:Jacobson}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $A$ be a ring. Then $x\in \calJ (A)$ iff $1-xy$ is a unit for all $y\in A$.
    \label{lemma:equiv-Jacobson}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    $\left( \Longrightarrow \right)$ Suppose that $x \in \calJ(A)$. Suppose that $1-xy$ is not a unit for some $y\in A$. Then there is some maximal ideal $m$ of $A$ containing $1-xy$. (Just consider the ideal generated by $1-xy$ and Remark \ref{rem:maximal-ideal-containing-some-ideal})

    Since $x\in \calJ(A)$, $x\in m$. So $xy\in m$ as $m$ is an ideal. Then $1= (1-xy)+xy \in m$ but this is not possible as maximal ideals are not the entire ring by definition! Hence $1-xy $ is a unit for all $y\in A$.

    $\left( \Longleftarrow \right)$ Now suppose that $1-xy$ is a unit for all $y\in A$. If $x\not \in \calJ (A)$ then there must be some maximal ideal $m$ of $A$ such that $x\in A\setminus m$. Now consider the ideal $m + (x)$. Clearly $m + (x) \supsetneq m$ for otherwise $x\in m$. Hence $m+ (x)=A$ as $m$ is a maximal ideal. Thus there are some elements $z\in m$ and $y \in A$ such that $z+xy =1$. But then $1-xy = z \in m$. Also, $1-xy$ is a unit, but that cannot possibly happen as maximal ideals cannot contain units!
\end{proof}
